#Presentation
NEED A BREAK is an application intended to help you take care of your health while you work on a computer. 
It will encourage you to regularly have a break in order to rest your back and your eyes.

I have made it for my personnal use and personnaly use it every day at work and it helps me to not sit for too long. So I decided to share it because maybe it could be useful to someone else.

Here are some screen shots of the UI :

#Get started
The project is a WPF application targetting .Net Framework 4.5.2. All you need is a copy of Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code in order to build it.
Once started, the application creates a coffee cup icon in the task bar to manifest its presence and permits user to interract with it. 
Just click on the coffee cup to open the application menu.

#Contribute
I'm sure this application could be improved in many ways and I would be happy to receive some help in doing so. 
Most of comments are in french, sorry for that ! I will translate them soon.
Every contribution is welcome, it includes, but is not limited to :
* Add new functionalities
* Improve translations
* Improve design
* Fix bugs
If you need inspiration there is a couple of todos in the main application file (but they're in french :)
